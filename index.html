<p   class="fon">The greatest actresses of the pre-60's, Hollywood's Golden Age. Here are all the actresses worth mentioning from this era. (The first 25 are ranked after AFI's 25 greatest actresses of all time, the rest are not ranked in order!)

    There were some I had to exclude because they did not have a picture here on IMDB and there were also those who begun their career in the fifties but who made it big after 1960.</p>
